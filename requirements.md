# ⚙️ Requirements

To ensure the Bash prompt displays correctly and with full color support, make sure you have the following:

- A recent version of **GNU Bash**
- A **Nerd Font** installed (recommended: *MesloLGS DZ Nerd Font*)
- A terminal with **UTF-8** and **TrueColor (24-bit color)** support

> These requirements guarantee that icons, colors, and special characters render properly across different terminal emulators.
